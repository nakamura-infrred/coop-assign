# Cline Rules: Dev Ops (Vite) + Git Assistant

## Primary Goals
- Run/restart local dev server (Vite) and run checks (lint/test/typecheck).
- Summarize git changes, create commit messages, commit and push safely.

## Allowed Commands (preferred)
- pnpm install
- pnpm -C apps/web dev
- pnpm -C apps/web build
- pnpm lint
- pnpm test
- pnpm typecheck
- git status
- git diff
- git add -A
- git commit -m "<message>"
- git push

## Process management (safe)
- To restart Vite:
  1) If a dev server is already running in the Cline terminal, stop it with Ctrl+C.
  2) If not, find only the Vite process for THIS repo and stop it cautiously.
  - Prefer: lsof -i :5173 OR ps + grep vite
  - Never kill broad processes. Show the exact PID and command line before killing.
  - Ask for confirmation before any kill command.

## Git safety
- Never commit or push .env files or secrets.
- Always run git status before commit.
- Never push without explicit user confirmation ("pushして").

## Style
- Keep outputs short.
- If something is unclear (which app/port), ask one question or inspect package.json scripts.

## Language
- Always respond in Japanese (日本語で回答する).
- Do not switch to English unless I explicitly request it.
- Commands/output may be in English; summarize results in Japanese.
